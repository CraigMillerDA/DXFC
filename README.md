<b>Digital Fiat Currency</b> - A Central Bank Digital Currency Proposal

The goal of this project is to create a working version of a digital currency.  Once the project is mature enough, we will submit it to central banks around the world as a <b>Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) proposal</b>.  There are many CBDC proposals being submitted world-wide.  DXFC is unique because most, if not all, proposals only aim to replace a single currency, while DXFC aims to ASSIST any currency.  DXFC is also the only CBDC proposal to include tax generation as key component on how Central Banks can benefit from using digital currencies.

Please take a look at the <b>"DXFC WhitepaperNEW.txt"</b> file within this repository for details.

The project needs blockchain developers/engineers, programmers, writers, public speakers and economists to name a few.  Anyone can contribute to the project and any contributions are greatly appreciated.

DXFC will function as the main blockchain connecting to every other blockchain based digital currency.  The DXFC blockchain has many purposes including instant currency exchange, a voting system, proposal system and will assist in compressing the side-chains.  Each digital currency will reside on it's own blockchain and is a side-chain of the DXFC blockchain.  So, every different currency (USD, EURO, GBP, JPY, etc) will be a side-chain of the DXFC blockchain.

Currently researching options for crowdfunding the project.  This will enable the hiring of qualified personel, a larger online presence and a project that gets to the proposal stage of creating a CBDC.

I will add to the readme as time permits and hope to see some contributors by the time I get back to adding!
